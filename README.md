# macos-mcp

MCP server for macOS that gives Claude access to Apple Mail, Calendar, Reminders, and Contacts. All reads hit SQLite databases directly for instant results — no slow AppleScript round-trips.

## Features

- **Apple Mail** — list, read, search, send, draft, reply, forward, move, flag emails
- **Full-text email search** — FTS5 index of email body content with snippets
- **Apple Calendar** — list, query, create, modify, delete events
- **Apple Reminders** — list, query, create, complete, delete reminders
- **Apple Contacts** — list, search, and get full contact details from the Address Book
- **Daily briefing** — one-call summary of today's events, due reminders, and unread mail
- **MCP resources** — browsable resources for accounts, calendars, lists, and contacts
- **Zero native dependencies** — uses macOS system `sqlite3` binary and JXA

## Requirements

- macOS 14+ (Sonoma or later)
- Node.js 20+
- **Full Disk Access** for your Claude client (Claude Desktop, terminal, etc.) — needed to read macOS databases

### Granting Full Disk Access

System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access:

1. Add **Claude Desktop** (for Claude Desktop usage)
2. Add **Terminal** or your terminal app (for Claude Code usage)
3. **Important:** Also add the **Node.js binary** itself — Claude Desktop spawns `node` as a child process, and it's the `node` process that reads the macOS databases. To add it:
   - Click **+** in Full Disk Access
   - Press **Cmd+Shift+G** and go to the output of `which node` (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/node/25.3.0/bin/`)
   - Select **node** and toggle it on

> **Note:** If you update Node.js (e.g., via Homebrew), the binary path changes and you'll need to re-add it to Full Disk Access.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/captainmark23/macos-mcp.git
cd macos-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

## Resources

|---|---|
| `macos://mail/accounts` | Email accounts |
| `macos://mail/{account}/mailboxes` | Mailboxes for an account |
| `macos://calendars` | All calendars |
| `macos://reminders/lists` | Reminder lists |
| `macos://contacts` | Contacts |

## Full-Text Email Search

The FTS5 index enables searching inside email body content — not just subjects and senders. Build it once, then incremental updates are fast.

```
# Build the full index (first time — takes a while for large mailboxes)
Use mail_fts_index with rebuild=true

# Incremental update (fast — only indexes new messages)
Use mail_fts_index

# Search
Use mail_search_body with query="invoice payment"
```

The index is stored at `~/.macos-mcp/mail-fts.db`. Clients that support progress notifications will receive real-time updates during indexing.

## Architecture

  index.ts              # MCP server — tool/resource registration and routing
  mail/
    tools.ts            # Mail reads (SQLite) and writes (JXA)
    fts.ts              # FTS5 full-text body search index
  calendar/
    tools.ts            # Calendar reads (SQLite) and writes (JXA)
  reminders/
    tools.ts            # Reminders reads (SQLite) and writes (JXA)

    tools.ts            # Contacts reads (SQLite)

    sqlite.ts           # Zero-dep SQLite query helper (/usr/bin/sqlite3)
    applescript.ts       # JXA execution helper with rate-limited write queue
    config.ts           # Environment variable configuration

    shared.test.ts      # Unit tests for shared utilities
```

**Read operations** query macOS SQLite databases directly via the system `sqlite3` binary with `-json -readonly` flags. This is orders of magnitude faster than AppleScript/JXA — calendar queries that took 1:46 via JXA complete in 14ms via SQLite.

**Write operations** use JXA (JavaScript for Automation) via `osascript`, which properly interfaces with the app APIs and respects macOS sandboxing. Writes are serialized via a queue and rate-limited (default: 10/minute).

## Troubleshooting

### Full Disk Access errors

If you see `SQLite error: unable to open database file` or similar permission errors, your terminal (or Claude Desktop) needs Full Disk Access:

**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access** → toggle on your terminal app and/or Claude Desktop. Restart the app after granting access.

### Automation / privacy permissions

Write operations (sending mail, creating events/reminders) use JXA which requires Automation access. If you see `-1743` errors or "not allowed assistive access":

**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation** → ensure your terminal/Claude Desktop has permission for Mail, Calendar, and Reminders.

### Reminders database not found

If `reminders_*` tools return "database directory not found", the Reminders container may not exist yet. Open Reminders.app once and create at least one reminder to initialize the database.

### Contacts database not found

If `contacts_*` tools return "Contacts database not found", open Contacts.app once to initialize the database. The server reads from `~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Sources/`.

### SQLite query timed out

Queries have a 10-second timeout by default. If you hit this on large mailboxes, try narrowing your search with filters (e.g., `filter: "today"`) or reducing the `limit` parameter.

### Write rate limit exceeded

Write operations are rate-limited to 10 per minute by default to prevent runaway agents. Adjust with the `MACOS_MCP_WRITE_RATE_LIMIT` environment variable.

### Node.js version

Requires Node.js 20+. Check with `node --version`. If you're on an older version, install a current LTS release via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

### FTS index issues

If `mail_search_body` returns no results, you need to build the FTS index first:

1. Run `mail_fts_index` (incremental — only indexes new messages)
2. Or run `mail_fts_index` with `rebuild=true` for a full re-index

The index is stored at `~/.macos-mcp/mail-fts.db` and can be safely deleted to start fresh.
